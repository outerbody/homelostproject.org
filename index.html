              Can we go home, Mommy?  I asked for the hundredth time.<br>
              The man next door is creepy and he&rsquo;s peeking through the blind.<br>
              I miss my toys and books and friends.  You said we wouldn't stay long.<br>
              My brother won&rsquo;t stop crying even when I sing our silly song.<br>
              I can't find my best dolly and I&rsquo;m missing my left shoe.<br>
              I think I left them both behind.  What am I to do?<br>
              I want to sleep in my own bed.  I cannot go to sleep.<br>
              It stinks in here and there&rsquo;s no TV.  This place gives me the creeps.<br>
              Can we go home Mommy?  I ask again, but I know.<br>
              Even though I want my home back, we have nowhere to go.<br>

              A poem written by Amy Adams on 04/16/2012 and shared with Griffin and Annie as a way to talk with them about her experience being homeless.  She and her two young children stayed at a 
              shelter and received services from Community Human Services Corporation.

          Annie and Griffin have really enjoyed sharing their progress with their friends at O'Hara Elementary. 
          These pictures were taken during their presentation to their classmates and during a recent trip to the Wood Street Commons Shelter.
