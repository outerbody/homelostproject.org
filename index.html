              Can we go home, Mommy?  I asked for the hundredth time.<br>
              The man next door is creepy and he&rsquo;s peeking through the blind.<br>
              I miss my toys and books and friends.  You said we wouldn't stay long.<br>
              My brother won&rsquo;t stop crying even when I sing our silly song.<br>
              I can't find my best dolly and I&rsquo;m missing my left shoe.<br>
              I think I left them both behind.  What am I to do?<br>
              I want to sleep in my own bed.  I cannot go to sleep.<br>
              It stinks in here and there&rsquo;s no TV.  This place gives me the creeps.<br>
              Can we go home Mommy?  I ask again, but I know.<br>
              Even though I want my home back, we have nowhere to go.<br>

              A poem written by Amy Adams on 04/16/2012 and shared with Griffin and Annie as a way to talk with them about her experience being homeless.  She and her two young children stayed at a 
              shelter and received services from Community Human Services Corporation.
