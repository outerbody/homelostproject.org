Annie Yonas and Griffin Kerstetter have been friends forever. One night last Fall they had a sleepover and read a book about people walking on the street. The book made them both think about the people that are walking on the streets all day and night. Independently they both told their parents that they wanted to help the homeless by helping people understand that homelessness is a problem.
<P>
Because many of the children in Annie&rsquo;s class have allergies they are not able to bring in food to celebrate birthday and holidays.  So she thought &quot;I can bring &lsquo;Sleep In for the Homeless T-shirts&rsquo;&quot; for her friends.  Her dad often wears his T-shirt from the awareness and fund raising event to help the homeless and Annie thought her friends would like T-shirts too!  So she told her Dad about her idea. 
<P>
Griffin thought that it would be good to make quilts out of donated T-shirts. Griffin has many T-shirts that are too small and she wanted to use them to make something to help keep the homeless warm.   So she told her Mom about her idea. 
<P>
Annie and Griffin&rsquo;s parents work together doing public health research at the University of Pittsburgh. They work closely with a community organization called Community Human Services that works with the homeless and runs a shelter.   Annie and Griffin&rsquo;s parents arranged for them to meet with Adrienne Walnoha, the executive director of Community Human Services. At that meeting, the HOMELOST project was made.  The group decided on a goal of making quilts for at least 50 people.

      Griffin:  <blockquote>At the very first meeting I was taking notes about the discussion.  I wasn't sure how to spell homeless so I created a symbol for the word.  I drew a picture of a house and then spelled out the word &quot;lost&quot; right next to it.</blockquote>

      Annie:  <blockquote>To help the homeless. There are over 2,300 people in Pittsburgh who are homeless.  Many of the homeless are families and children.  We want to make sure that people know about this problem and that we all do something to help.  The quilts are a gift that can keep them warm.</blockquote>   
      Griffin:<blockquote>Annie and I went to the Wood Street Commons shelter with Adrienne and talked with two women who have been homeless.  We learned they are really nice and kind.  We talked about their favorite colors and foods.  We learned that we have a lot in common.</blockquote>
